<p>3. Which information we may collect on our Users?</p>
<p>We may collect two types of information from our Users:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (&ldquo;<strong>Non-personal Information</strong>&rdquo;). <strong>We are not aware of the identity of the User from whom we have collected the Non-personal Information.</strong> Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which does not enable identification of an individual User, and which is available to us while such User is accessing or using the Site or Services. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information, behavioral information and aggregated information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on the Site or Services, User's 'click-stream' or searches on the Site, heatmaps, referring / exit pages and URLs, type and version of browser and keyboard language, the hardware specifications of the User's device (including screen resolution and screen orientation), time spent on various pages of the Site, etc.
<ol>
<li>The second type of information is individually identifiable information (&ldquo;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&rdquo;). <strong>This information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Users of the Site may automatically provide their IP address (or Mac Address, as applicable) mainly for enhancing the User&rsquo;s experience and for geo-location and security purposes as further detailed below.</li>
<li>Users who are interested in opening an Account are required to provide the following details: full name, country, zip code, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, general or specific areas of interest (e.g. upper/lower body, etc.), categories of interest (e.g. cosmetic surgery, dermatology, plastic surgery, body contouring etc.) and a password. The Users may also choose to provide us with the following details: ethnicity or specific procedure interest.</li>
<li><strong>Alternatively</strong>, you can open an Account by integrating your existing third party accounts (such as, Facebook) ("<strong>Social Network Account</strong>") with your Account. If you authorize such integration, then certain information contained in your Social Network Account may be transmitted into your Account (e.g. log-in information, your public profile, profile picture, list of friends and followers, likes/dislikes, number of views or other information which is detailed in the notice which appears during the integration process with your Social Network Account).</li>
<li>Using the Services may generate Personal Information, including without limitation: articles saved by the User before or after the log-in or registration process, information the User provides while using the Interactive Areas, including interactions with other Users (if such function is made available by MEDSPA.ONE ).</li>
<li>The Services include a feature that enables Users to find and contact physicians (usually those located in the User's geographic area). When using this feature, you voluntarily provide the physician with your full name, email address, telephone number and your desired treatment.</li>
<li>You may voluntarily provide Personal Information in your Submissions/Physician Submissions or when you fill the Contact Form on our Site.</li>
<li>When a physician opens an Account, he/she will be required to use certain online payment methods which require him/her to provide to the online payment service providers certain Personal Information (such as, a credit card number and other related billing information).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as any Non-Personal Information is connected or linked to any Personal Information, we treat it as Personal Information. <strong>We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval. Your approval is obtained, when you agree to our Terms and the Privacy Policy upon accessing or using our Site or Services.</strong></p>

By way of example, when you open an Account, fill out the Contact Form, use the Interactive Areas or provide any information with your Submissions/Physician Submissions; we may collect and save such information. Please note that your Submission/Physician Submissions, especially those uploaded or shared within the Interactive Areas are non-confidential, become publicly available and may be collected, used or redistributed by others through the internet and other media channels.</p>
<p>5. What are the Purposes of the Collection of Information?</p>
